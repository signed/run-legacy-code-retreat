You have a good reason to change the production code?
Build a safety net first!

When touching the legacy code we need to focus on our purpose:

* add a feature
* fix a bug
* make the system testable.

Why Not to change legacy code

- it looks ugly
- I would like to see nicer code
- I want to update to newest framework

=== Potential Testing Seams

[quote, Michael Feathers, 'Working Effectively with Legacy Code']
____
A Seam is a place where you can alter behavior in your program without editing in that place.
____

Maybe you need to make small changes to open those seams (be careful!)

Potential seam
* Logging
* Events
* Database
* Calls to external systems
* pre processor
* linker magic

When to use?
- Mature systems that do not change that often anymore
- If you have output you can check (Test seams)
- Any output you can diff
- http://wiki.c2.com/?SoftwareSeam

available tooling in java for automatic generation of characterization tests:

=== Capture console output
- Run the game with the GameRunner and capture the output
- Write output to file
- Execute GameRunner again and compare with file content
- Run multiple games to get a decent coverage

-> A safety net is not a parachute!

* Benefit: you do not have to change the production code
* Benefit: you do not need to understand the code
* Blackbox testing strategy
* keep your golden master tests
