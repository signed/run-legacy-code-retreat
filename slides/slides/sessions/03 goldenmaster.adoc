You have a good reason to change the production code?
Build a safety net first!

When touching the legacy code we need to focus on our purpose:

* add a feature
* fix a bug
* make the system testable.

Why Not to change legacy code

- it looks ugly
- I would like to see nicer code
- I want to update to newest framework

A safety net is not a parachute.

=== Potential Testing Seams
* Logging
* Events
* Database
* Calls to external systems

Maybe you need to make small changes to open those seems (be careful)

When to use?
- Mature systems that do not change that often anymore
- If you have output you can check (Test seams)
- Any output you can diff
