TRIVIA-34:: Wrong output

After giving the right answer in some cases the printed message is wrong.
We see `Answer was correct!!!!` but we are expecting to get `Answer was corrent!!!!`.

Please fix.

Surprised?

=== Strategy
. Reproduce with system level test
. Isolate the area you want to change to make it testable
. write unit tests to document the current behaviour
- Write failing test that forces you to make the fix
- Make the fix; Ensure the system test and the 1st unit test are failing
- Delete the 1st unit test
- Adjust the the expectation in the system test
