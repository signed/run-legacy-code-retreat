TRIVIA-34:: Wrong output

After giving the right answer in some cases the printed message is wrong.

Actual:  `Answer was correct!!!!`

Expected: `Answer was corrent!!!!`.

Surprised?

=== Strategy
. Reproduce with system level test
. Open the area you want to change to unit tests
. write unit tests to document the current behaviour
. Write failing test that forces you to make the fix
. Make the fix; Ensure the system test and the 1st unit test are failing
. Delete the 1st unit test
. Adjust the the expectation in the system test
