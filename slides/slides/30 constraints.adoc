== Recommendations

* At least one person of the pair should know the language
* Use version control
* Practice Baby Steps
** focus on one change at the time
** run your tests often
** make small commits with descriptive commit messages

=== A word on Characterization tests
* Assumption: what the current code does is correct
* The current behaviour should not change unless explicitly requested
* Identify characteristic system use and lock it down with an automated test

Keep your characterization tests between sessions.

=== Constraints

* new code is developed test first
* production code not covered by tests -> no manual changes
* not possible to cover -> automated refactorings to open a test seam
* untestable code can be adapted using as little changes as possible to make it testable (high risk)
* Follow the constraints of the session
