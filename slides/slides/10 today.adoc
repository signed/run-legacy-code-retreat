=== Why is this important
[quote, 'http://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/[J. B. Rainsberger^]']
____
Legacy code is valuable code that we feel afraid to change.
____
Practice techniques to change legacy code in a low stakes environment.

=== Its about practicing and learning

* learn from each other
* experiment, get outside your comfort zone
* deliberate practice
* there is no pressure to get something done
* make mistakes without consequences

[NOTE.speaker]

* Whatever you do, do what you don't normally do!
* At least for one person in the pair.
* Its not about completing a task, its about practicing and learning

=== How do we practice?
* Like a Code Retreat but with existing code
** pick a new pair partner for each session
** throw away your code after the session
* Introduced in 2012 by https://twitter.com/jbrains[J.B. Rainsberger]
