== The goals of the day

* experiment
* deliberate practice
* learn from each other

* Better introduce the exercises

=== How will the day look like
* run 6 sessions
* a session consists of
** ~5min Introduction of a technique
** ~40min of pair programming
** ~10min retrospective with the whole group
** ~5min break
* Retrospective over the whole day

=== Legacy Code Retreat
- Like a Code Retreat but with existing code
- Introduced in 2012 by https://twitter.com/jbrains[J.B. Rainsberger]
- http://blog.adrianbolboaca.ro/2014/04/legacy-coderetreat/[Session proposals^] from https://twitter.com/adibolb[Adrian Bolboaca^]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Who has been on a code retreat?
* Who knows what legacy code is?

- keep your end to end characterization test

=== Goal of Today

Whatever you do, do what you don't normally do!
At least for one Person in the pair.

=== Setup
https://github.com/jbrains/trivia

=== General rules while working with legacy code
- use version control
- make small commits
- run your tests as often as you can
-

- code not covered by tests -> no manual changes
- not possible to cover -> automated refactorings to open a test seam
- all new code you write, test first!

== Recommendations
- At least one person of the pair should know the language
-

== The rules

- new code is developed test first
- existing code is only changed if covered by a test
- untestable code can be adapted using as little changes as possible to make it testable (high risk)


== Why change legacy code

http://blog.adrianbolboaca.ro/2015/02/extract-class/
When touching the legacy code we need to focus on our purpose: add a feature, fix a bug or make the system testable.

== Why Not to change legacy code
- it looks ugly
- I would like to see nicer code
- I want to update to newest framework
