* who has experience with pair programming?
* who knows what the idea behind pair programming is?
* if needed, we'll make adjustments
* introduce the facilitators that act as product owner, domain expert and contact person
* move around the room and answer you questions, looking at your code, giving hints

=== The goals of the day

* learn from each other
* experiment, get outside your comfort zone
* deliberate practice
* there is no pressure to get something done

Whatever you do, do what you don't normally do!
At least for one person in the pair.
