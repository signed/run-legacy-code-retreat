== Potential Testing Seams
* Logging
* Events
* Database

Maybe you need to make small changes to open those seems (be careful)

=== When to use?
- Mature systems that do not change that often anymore
- If you have output you can check (Test seams)
- Any output you can diff

Its a safety net, not a parachute.
