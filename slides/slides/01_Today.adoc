=== Goal of Today

Whatever you do, do what you don't normally do!

=== Setup
https://github.com/jbrains/trivia

=== General rules while working with legacy code
- use version control
- make small commits
- run your tests as often as you can
-

- code not covered by tests -> no manual changes
- not possible to cover -> automated refactorings to open a test seam
- all new code you write, test first!

== Recommendations
- At least one person of the pair should know the language
-
