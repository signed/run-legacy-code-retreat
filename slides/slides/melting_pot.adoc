=== Constraints

For the last two iterations of the day, ask people to switch pairs before the last iteration, but let them keep their changes and continue working from that point.

=== Characterization test

- setting up a safety net
- only focus on inputs and outputs
- do not make changes to the production code

=== Definitions
Legacy Code:: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_code

Characterization tests:: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization_test n computer programming, a characterization test is a means to describe (characterize) the actual behavior of an existing piece of software, and therefore protect existing behavior of legacy code against unintended changes via automated testing.
This term was coined by Michael Feathers.

=== Legacy Code
[quote, Michael Feathers, 'Working Effectively with Legacy Code']
____
To me, legacy code is simply code without tests.

Surviving Legacy Code with Golden Master and Sampling


=== What is important when working with legacy code
. Every change needs a Why and a stopping point
. Focus on on thing at the time
. Reading Code
.. Active code reading (rename )
. Executing Code
. Get test coverage
. Refactoring
.. Mikado method https://mikadomethod.wordpress.com/
. Take small steps
.. Run your tests
. Commit often
. Make sure that your test are failing in the way you expect them to
. Use automated refactorings where possible
.. Know their limitations/quirks/bugs
. Get your dependencies under control
.. Dependency inversion
.. Dependency injection
.. Extract and override
.. Power Mocking tools

Structure changes vs. Functional changes

=== What makes legacy code hard to test
static dependencies are the problem, meaning we can not exchange them in our tests

How to tackle this:
. dependency Injection
.. pass as arguments
.. Constructor / passed to the method under test
.. pure functions
.. setters
. Extend and override
. Use fancy power mocking tools.


Road to happiness:  eadding black box system tests to create a safety net -> characterization tests -> component tests -> unit tests


=== Notes on golden master
When to use?
- Mature systems that do not change that often anymore
- If you have output you can check (Test seams)
- Any output you can diff
- http://wiki.c2.com/?SoftwareSeam

available tooling in java for automatic generation of characterization tests:

==== Goldenmaster
- focus on the outputs
- only try to understand as much of the code to be able to run deterministic tests
- learning: this kind of tests can be setup without deep system / domain knowledge

* Spot duplication
** The rule of three says that it is a good idea to extract these elements, with the purpose to minimize the duplication, only when you spot them three times.
*** duplication can be found in
*** magic constants
*** variables
*** code blocks
*** methods
*** classes
*** modules
*** names
*** ...
* extract methods with good names
* Get rid of or at least reduce the visible scope of local variables in methods

- Make the code you think is duplication look similar to validate that is actually the same code
