## Feedback
The final retrospective brought out several goods:
* good format: each iteration is almost independent.
* Clearly defined goals.
* Variety of languages and people.
* Location and food (Talent Garden in Milan and breakfast offered by XPeppers).

And several bads too, to resolve for the next editions:
* no theoretical introduction on how to work with the legacy code.
* Difficulties in using Extract Class, with respect to Extract Method and Extract Field which are local changes.
* Difficulties in introducing unit-level tests.
