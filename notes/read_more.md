# Previous Retreats

## 2nd One
JB facilitated the event like you could find in [here](http://legacycoderetreat.typepad.com/blog/2011/11/how-i-run-legacy-code-retreat.html), with a lot of details.
But in short we would start with a
* free session
* Golden Masters
* Subclass to Test
* Replace Inheritance with Delegation
* Pure Functions
After each iteration we deleted the code like in any other coderetreat and swapped the pairs.
