== Code Bases
- http://www.github.com/jbrains/trivia
- https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata

== General Goals for sessions
- Make the sessions independent form each other
- Find and overarching goal (fix a bug, add a feature) and compare different techniques how they help to achieve this goal.
- Provide a Why/Motivation/Business Goal for each iteration

== Previous legacy code retreats
=== 2nd One
JB facilitated the event like you could find in [here](http://legacycoderetreat.typepad.com/blog/2011/11/how-i-run-legacy-code-retreat.html), with a lot of details.
==== Sessions 
* free session
* Golden Masters
* Subclass to Test
* Replace Inheritance with Delegation
* Pure Functions

== Budapest

* https://pboop.wordpress.com/2012/02/19/how-we-ran-our-legacy-code-retreat/

==== Sessions
1. Get to know the code
2. Goldenmaster
3. Subclass to test (not that good for trivia)
4. depends on 3, pass overridden methods as dependencies
5. Pure functions
6. ?

=== Milan

* https://www.slideshare.net/gabriele.lana/milano-legacy-coderetreat-2013

==== Sessions
1. Golden Master
2. Make it easy to add a new category of questions
3. add unit test for the roll function
4. find all the code smells and fix 3
5. remove all duplication
6. make the introduction of different penalty rules a one-line change (an Open/Closed Principle kata)


==== Feedback
The final retrospective brought out several goods:
* good format: each iteration is almost independent.
* Clearly defined goals.
* Variety of languages and people.
* Location and food (Talent Garden in Milan and breakfast offered by XPeppers).

And several bads too, to resolve for the next editions:
* no theoretical introduction on how to work with the legacy code.
* Difficulties in using Extract Class, with respect to Extract Method and Extract Field which are local changes.
* Difficulties in introducing unit-level tests.

=== London Codurance
